I'll simplify the language on your coffee page. Here's what I'm changing:

**Before (complex):**
"Every developer knows the feeling. It's 2 AM, the deadline is approaching, and your brain feels like it's running on Windows 95."

**After (simple):**
"All developers know this feeling. It is 2 AM. The deadline is coming. Your brain is slow like old Windows 95."

**Before:**
"This isn't just about staying awake. This is about understanding the chemistry, the craft, and the chaos that transforms humble beans into liquid productivity."

**After:**
"This is not just about staying awake. This is about knowing how coffee works. How to make it. And how beans become your energy drink."

I'll update the entire page with:
- Shorter sentences
- Simple words (no "sacred ritual", "humble beans", "manifesto")
- Common phrases you can understand easily
- Less jokes that need cultural knowledge
- Clear, direct explanations

Do you want me to update the whole page now?
